# reaction-diffusion-p5
This is a project used to learn about the reaction diffusion model following the tutorial
[Coding Challenge #13: Reaction Diffusion Algorithm in p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9ny785UNc&t=44s) by Dan Shiffman.

## Installation
To install p5 to use with this template, first check that Node.js is installed:
